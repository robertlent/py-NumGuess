# Number Guess

Number Guess is a Python number guessing game.

The player has 5 chances to correctly guess the randomly generated number between 1 and 50.

Currently does not handle input of letters, and will only re-prompt the player once if they input a guess outside of the range.

### Requirements
The application requires Python 3 be installed on your computer. After downloading and unzipping the files, you can then run the command 'python numguess.py' from inside of the unzipped folder.
