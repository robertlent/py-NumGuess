			<p>
				This is a number guessing game that I made using Python. The player is given 5 chances to guess a random number between 1 and 50, and is told whether their guess was too high or too low after each guess.

				<br><em>Note: While the exe is a single file that you can use to run the program, if you download the source code, you will need Python on your computer in order to run the Python Script.<br>You can download Python <a href='https://www.python.org/download/' target="_blank"><strong>here.</strong></a><br>However, you can view the code in any text editor. I prefer Notepad++, which can be downloaded <a href='http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.6.6.html' target="_blank"><strong>here.</strong></a></em>
